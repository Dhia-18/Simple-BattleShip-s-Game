# BattleShip Game

## Introduction

Welcome to my very first Java projectâ€”BattleShip! ðŸŽ‰ This is a simple two-player game where each player strategically places ships on their board and then attempts to sink the other playerâ€™s fleet by guessing the coordinates of their ships. The goal is to be the first to sink all of your opponentâ€™s ships.

## How it Works

1. Players Set Up Their Ships: Each player selects specific coordinates on a grid where they will place their fleet of ships.
2. Taking Turns: Players take turns firing at their opponentâ€™s board by guessing coordinates. If a ship occupies that location, it gets hit!
3. Victory Condition: The game continues until one player successfully sinks all of the other playerâ€™s ships.

## Why I Built This

Iâ€™ve recently started learning Java, and this BattleShip game is my first-ever project in this programming language. I wanted to dive into object-oriented programmin and explore how game logic can be implemented. Building this game has been a great way to challenge myself and practice concepts like loops, conditionals, and working with 2D arrays.

## Features

- Two-player Mode: Both players take turns playing against each other.
- Simple Game Logic: A grid-based system where players try to guess ship locations.

## What I Learned

Through this project, Iâ€™ve gained a deeper understanding of Java fundamentals, especially:
- Working with arrays and loops.
- Designing classes and methods to handle game logic.
- Handling user input and providing real-time feedback.

## Future Improvements

- Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience.
